# My Journey
I graduated in 2015, and like many others, I decided to give government exams a serious shot. To support myself during prep, I started tutoring, and to my surprise, it picked up really well. I genuinely enjoyed teaching, and since it was financially rewarding too, I stuck with it until 2020. But then the pandemic hit, many of my students dropped off, and that’s when I decided to shift gears for something more stable. I prepared for banking services and eventually cracked the SBI Junior Associate exam. I was posted in Pratapgarh in 2023. However, after about 9–10 months there, I realized two things: the work felt quite mundane, and I was actually doing better financially as a tutor. So, I chose to return to tutoring.

And this is where it gets interesting. After I left SBI, I found myself in that classic “what's next?” phase, constantly going back and forth, trying to figure out what truly interests me. I’d always believed that anything technical or coding-related just wasn’t my thing. But then, purely by chance, I stumbled upon a free data analysis course on YouTube. It jumped straight into the coding screen with simple explanations, and I thought -why not give it a shot? Next thing I know, three hours had flown by and I was completely hooked. It just clicked with me in a way I never expected. That moment changed everything and I knew I wanted to dive deeper.

I then got an opportunity to work at a small firm, where I developed the skills needed for data analysis. Now I’m ready to onboard into bigger roles and opportunities to further sharpen my skills and grow.
